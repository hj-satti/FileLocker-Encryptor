# 🔐 File Locker & Encryptor (C++ Project)

This C++ program allows you to:
- 🔒 Encrypt a text file using a password
- 🔓 Decrypt the file back using the same password

## 📁 How it Works
- Reads each character from your file
- Adds/subtracts password characters using ASCII values
- Saves to a new file (`encrypted.txt` or `decrypted.txt`)

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- File handling (ifstream/ofstream)
- Character manipulation
- Strings & ASCII
- Simple encryption logic

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Put your text in `sample.txt`
2. Run `main.cpp` with a C++ compiler
3. Choose Encrypt or Decrypt
